/**
    line-height = font-size * 1.1-3  - for headers
    line-height = font-size * 1.3-5  - fro body

    letter-spacing = -2%  - only for headers

    if there is too much text in the body (>3 lines), align text to the left
    However, dont make a mistake of having different allignment for header and body

    50 - 75 chracters, 600 px width - only for body

    stick to only 2 font sizes: to indicate hierarchy use color and weight 

    make a spacing between UI elements based on their relationship, 2 paragraphs further away rasther header and body
